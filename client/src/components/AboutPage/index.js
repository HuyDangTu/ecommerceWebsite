                    <p>Our founders started out as a group of childhood friends that all had a passion for nature and the outdoors. Post college, they ended up becoming roommates. Turns out, having a home filled with plants was something they continued to have in common. Unfortunately, they found it difficult to find a place online to purchase houseplants that was easy to navigate and wasnâ€™t just geared to wholesale. So, in 2017, they decided to launch HousePlantShop.com to be the ultimate destination for everything houseplants.
                    Originally working out of the humble house they shared, HousePlantShop.com has now grown to occupy a much larger and well equipped greenhouse based in Southern California.
                    Today, we still treat every order with the same care as we did working out of the small backyard and garage we started in.
